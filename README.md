# boneWidget

2.7 explanation : https://vimeo.com/184159913

list of bugs/todos:
-when the objects are created they do not match the action size
-matching the bone position not working in current api

-connect user preferences to the functions
  -need to edit json function addRemoveWidgets to use the prefix
-add operator to show/hide the collections

-add property to be able to rotate the widgets
-edit it so that the data name of the widgets is the same as the object name
(this makes it easier to import the mesh to another file)

-add function to clear widget from bone

-improve the ui
